# Fish Weight Predictor
MiniProject using ML and web development 


This project predicts the weight of a fish based on its physical measurements (length, height, and width) using Polynomial Regression. The model is trained on a dataset sourced from Kaggle.

🖥️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js
Backend: Flask
Machine Learning: scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
📌 Features

✅ User-friendly interface for inputting fish measurements
✅ Interactive data visualizations
✅ Predicts fish weight using a trained regression model
✅ Deployed using Flask as a backend API

📊 Dataset

The dataset includes various fish species with attributes like length, height, width, and weight. Feature engineering and data preprocessing were applied to improve model accuracy.

🚀 How It Works

The user enters the fish's length, height, and width in the web interface.
The data is sent to the Flask backend, where the trained Polynomial Regression Model makes a prediction.
The predicted fish weight is displayed on the webpage.![Screenshot 2025-01-19 at 10 54 04 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66ea8749-89e3-4e32-b00f-e6c97ae1ef9b)
